# MusicPlayer - State

This software simulates the operation of a music player - it implements the **Design Pattern State** in visualizing how the playlist is shown to the user, and the **Design Pattern Fa√ßade** by offering the user an interface to interact with the playlist itself, which allows the user to sort the playlist and make song queries; which are implemented through **Streams**.
